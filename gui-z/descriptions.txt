PGA / PGV / PGD
<b>Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA)</b> signifies the greatest instantaneous acceleration experienced by the ground at a specific site during an earthquake. Typically expressed as a percentage of the acceleration due to gravity (%g), it's a primary indicator of the shaking's intensity and directly influences the inertial forces that structures must withstand. PGA is a fundamental parameter in seismic hazard mapping and plays a crucial role in building code design requirements for earthquake-resistant construction, reflecting the initial forces structures are subjected to.

<b>Peak Ground Velocity (PGV)</b> represents the maximum instantaneous speed of ground motion during an earthquake. This parameter is particularly vital for assessing potential damage to structures, especially those with intermediate to long natural periods, like taller buildings. High PGV values are strongly correlated with the kinetic energy transferred to a structure, leading to significant structural drift, shear deformations, and potential damage to non-structural elements.

<b>Peak Ground Displacement (PGD)</b> refers to the largest transient or permanent displacement of the ground from its original position during an earthquake. PGD provides insight into the overall ground deformation and is highly relevant for evaluating the performance of foundations, buried infrastructure such as pipelines and tunnels, and assessing risks associated with ground failure phenomena like liquefaction and landslides. Large PGD can induce significant strain in structures, potentially leading to foundation damage or differential settlement.

Fourier Transform
<b>The Fourier Transform</b> is a powerful mathematical technique used to decompose an earthquake's time-domain ground motion signal into its constituent frequency components in the frequency domain.

Amplitude Spectrum: <b>The Amplitude Spectrum</b> illustrates the relative strength or intensity of each individual frequency present in the ground motion. Prominent peaks in the amplitude spectrum highlight the dominant frequencies at which the ground shakes most vigorously. Identifying these dominant frequencies is critical for structural engineers, as they can lead to resonance if they coincide with a structure's natural vibration period, significantly amplifying the building's response.

Phase Spectrum: <b>The Phase Spectrum</b> provides information about the relative timing or phase relationships among the different frequency components. While the amplitude spectrum quantifies "how much" of each frequency exists, the phase spectrum reveals "when" these frequencies occur relative to each other within the overall signal. Though often less directly interpreted in basic engineering analysis, the phase spectrum is essential for the accurate reconstruction of the time-domain signal and influences the sequence and characteristics of ground motion pulses, which can impact structural behavior.
###
Bracketed Duration
<b>Bracketed Duration</b> quantifies the effective length of strong shaking during an earthquake. It is defined as the time interval between the first and last exceedance of a predefined threshold acceleration, commonly set at 0.05g (5% of gravitational acceleration). Unlike the total duration of a seismic record, bracketed duration focuses on the period during which the ground motion is intense enough to cause cumulative damage or fatigue in structures. A longer bracketed duration implies prolonged exposure to significant shaking, which can be more detrimental to a structure's integrity over time, even at moderate peak accelerations.
###
Site Frequency
<b>Site Frequency</b>, also known as the predominant site period, describes the natural vibration frequency at which a specific soil deposit or geological formation tends to amplify seismic waves. This characteristic frequency is primarily determined by the soil's stiffness, depth, and layering. Understanding the site frequency is paramount in earthquake engineering because it helps assess the risk of "site-structure resonance." If the natural frequency of a building matches the site frequency, the ground motion can be significantly amplified as it propagates through the soil, leading to an exaggerated structural response, potentially causing severe damage or even collapse.
###
Arias Intensity
<b>Arias Intensity (Ia)</b> is an energy-based parameter that provides a cumulative measure of the total energy content of earthquake ground motion. It is calculated by integrating the square of the ground acceleration time history over the entire duration of shaking. Unlike peak ground motion parameters, which capture instantaneous maximums, Arias Intensity accounts for both the amplitude and the duration of shaking, offering a more comprehensive indicator of the ground motion's potential to induce damage related to cumulative inelastic deformation in structures. A higher Arias Intensity suggests a greater capacity for ground motion to cause structural damage.
###
Response Spectra
<b>Response Spectrum</b> is a graphical representation that summarizes the maximum response (e.g., maximum acceleration, velocity, or displacement) of an infinite series of idealized single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems with varying natural periods and damping ratios, when subjected to a particular earthquake ground motion. It is a cornerstone of seismic design and analysis, as it allows engineers to directly visualize how structures with different fundamental frequencies would react to the recorded shaking. Engineers utilize response spectra to establish seismic design forces for new buildings, evaluate the vulnerability of existing structures, and characterize the seismic hazard at a specific site.
###
P & S Wave Annotation
<b>P-wave (Primary wave)</b> and <b>S-wave (Secondary wave)</b> annotation involves precisely identifying and marking the arrival times of these two distinct types of seismic waves on an earthquake ground motion record, typically on the acceleration time history.

P-waves: As compressional waves, <b>P-waves</b> are the fastest seismic waves and thus the first to arrive at a recording station. They cause particle motion in the same direction as wave propagation, generating a push-pull effect.

S-waves: <b>S-waves</b> are shear waves and travel slower than P-waves, arriving subsequently. They cause particles to move perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and are often responsible for the most significant ground shaking and structural damage due to their larger amplitudes. Annotating their arrival times is critical for accurately locating the earthquake source, determining the event's origin time, and understanding the sequence of strong shaking that a structure experiences. This distinction is also vital for various seismological studies and early warning systems.
